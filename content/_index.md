# Bio

Viviana is a passionate scientist originally from Colombia. She earned her Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering and a Master's degree in Materials Science from Universidad Nacional de Colombia Sede Medellín, where she conducted research on the assembly of nematic colloids under the guidance of Professor Hernández-Ortiz. As a Fulbright Scholar with funding from Colciencias, she continued to pursue her academic career in the US.

Since joining the PME in the autumn of 2016, Viviana has been working under the guidance of Professor de Pablo to develop models and methods for liquid crystalline materials. Her research is focused on understanding their response to external stimuli and exploring their potential applications as sensing devices.
